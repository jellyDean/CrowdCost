Easy MailChimp Forms allows you to painlessly add MailChimp sign up forms to your WordPress site and track user activity with interactive reports.

== Description ==

Easy MailChimp Forms allows you to painlessly add MailChimp sign up forms to your WordPress site. You can add forms to posts, pages or sidebars with shortcodes, widgets or template tags. Simply copy and paste your MailChimp API Key into the plugin admin settings and it will pull in all your MailChimp lists. From there you can choose the lists you want to make forms for. For a single list you can check off the fields you want to include on your form and order them via an easy drag-and-drop interface. This plugin adds plenty of CSS selectors to the form code allowing you to completely customize the look of your forms. Now with the ability to track sent campaigns, you can view and print interactive reports from based on previously sent campaigns.

**Note:** You will need a MailChimp API key to allow this plugin to communicate with your MailChimp account. For help on retrieving your API key, check out [question #4 of the FAQ](http://wordpress.org/plugins/yikes-inc-easy-mailchimp-extender/faq/). You can also read the MailChimp knowledge base article [Where can I find my API key and how can I use the API](http://kb.mailchimp.com/article/where-can-i-find-my-api-key/).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to have a MailChimp Account? =
Yes, you can register for one for free at [MailChimp](https://login.mailchimp.com/signup? "MailChimp").

= Do I need to have lists already set up in MailChimp? =
Yes, you have to have at least 1 list set up in MailChimp. 

For more help, visit the MailChimp Support article [How do I create a new list?](http://kb.mailchimp.com/article/where-can-i-find-my-api-key "How do I create a new list?")

= What do I do first? =
The first step is to add your MailChimp API key. This will allow your site to communicate with your MailChimp account. This is done on the plugin "MailChimp Settings" page.

= Where do I find my API Key? =
From your MailChimp Dashboard, click on your account name in the upper left hand corner of the screen under the MailChimp logo to expose the "Account Settings" menu. Click on "Account Settings" to go to the Account Settings screen and the click on the "Extras" menu. Under "Extras" choose "API keys." From there you can create a new key if you do not already have one.

For more help, visit the MailChimp Support article [Where can I find my API Key?](http://kb.mailchimp.com/article/where-can-i-find-my-api-key "Where can I find my API Key?")

= How to I add my MailChimp lists? =
After you add your API key, the plugin will fetch all of your MailChimp list information and load it into the plugin admin. Go to the plugin "Manage List Forms" page to choose the lists you want to make forms for.

= How do I add the MailChimp sign up forms to my site? =
You can use a shortcode to add a form to a page or post, use the MailChimp form button in the visual editor or use a widget to add it to a sidebar. Each list on the plugin "Manage List Forms" displays a shortcode at the top. Copy the shortcode and paste it into any post or page where you want a form to appear. For example, if my form had the shortcode [yks-mailchimp-list id="1234567891"] I would copy and paste that into the page or post I wanted to add that form to.

= I input a valid MailChimp API key, but it returns invalid every time. I've already tried a new API key, but no dice. What's up? =

**Step 1:** Ensure that cURL is enabled at the server level. You will see an error at the top of the settings page if cURL is disabled. If you see no error, continue to step 2.

**Step 2:** If you have entered your MailChimp API key and are still getting the error "*Error: Please enter a valid Mail Chimp API Key*," please check the developer console inside your browser for further information. 

- Right-click in the API Key input field, and select 'Inpsect Element'
- Once the developer console is open, select the Console tab to view a more specific error returned from the MailChimp API.

For information on how to use your browser's developer console, read the WordPress Codex article, [Using Your Browser to Diagnose JavaScript Errors](http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Your_Browser_to_Diagnose_JavaScript_Errors).

**Possible Errors And Resolutions**

* Could not resolve host: xxxx.api.mailchimp.com  - the host you have provided is incorrect. The host is the string after the last dash (example: us2)
* Invalid Mailchimp API Key: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxx - Your API key is invalid. You can confirm a valid key by logging into [MailChimp](http://mailchimp.com) and checking the active API key registered to your account.

= I don't want the form to be the 100% width. How can I adjust the width myself? =
You can adjust the width of the forms on your site by changing the width of the element with the class .yks-mailchimpFormContainer. This is the parent container for the form. Adjusting this width will control the width of the input fields inside of it.

= How can I translate this plugin? =
Easy MailChimp Forms is now translated into multiple languages:

* Arabic
* Chinese
* English
* French
* German
* Greek
* Hebrew
* Hindi

Read the Codex article [Installing WordPress in Your Language](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress_in_Your_Language) for more information. Also, please refer to our [Developer Docs](http://wordpress.org/plugins/yikes-inc-easy-mailchimp-extender/other_notes/).

= Do you provide any hooks, or filters for me to take advantage of? =
Yes! With the 4.0 version of our plugin we have added a few hooks that allow you to add or manipulate existing data. Check out the [Other Notes](http://wordpress.org/plugins/yikes-inc-easy-mailchimp-extender/other_notes/) tab for more information.

= Do you offer integration with reCAPTCHA? I keep getting spam entries from bots and spammers. =
Yes! Since version 4.4 of Easy MailChimp Extender, we have added [reCAPTCHA](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/index.html) support. You can sign up for a reCAPTCHA API key [here](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin#whyrecaptcha). You will need to provide your <em>public</em> key as well as the <em>private</em> key. Don't worry, its free :)

= When I input my API key and hit save, it immediately reverts to a much shorter string of text and returns invalid. What's going on? =
You most likely have a password manager installed and active (LastPass, OnePass, TeamPassword etc.). The API key input field is set to type="password" for security reasons. Most password managers auto-fill password fields based on the URL of the current page. So, what happens when you click save is that the password manager auto fills in the field with the password that you have saved for your site, and thus returning 'invalid API key'. To resolve the issue you'll need to temporarily disable any active password manager and re-enter and save your API key. Once the key has been successfully saved, you can re-enable your password manager.

= How do I create my own custom MailChimp template? =
**Step 1:** 
First you'll want to import the boilerplate template files bundled with the plugin. These are files that were created for easy customization. You can import the boilerplate files by going to the manage list forms page and clicking 'import boilerplate templates'. 

<em>Note :</em> Alternatively, you can manually import the template files by copying the 'yikes-mailchimp-user-templates' directory inside of the plugin root ( 'yikes-inc-easy-mailchimp-extender/templates/' ) over to your theme root. ( ie: /wp-content/themes/twentyfourteen/ ).

**Step 2:** 
Once imported you'll find the boilerplate files in your theme root. Each boilerplate template file comes with an associated .css file located inside of the styles directory. To get started on your first template, we recommend that you duplicate one of the existing boilerplate tempalate files and its associated .css file, and changing the name.

**Step 3:** 
Finally, change the MailChimp template, author and description headers at the top of each template file. The 'MailChimp Template' header dictates the name of your template, and what will appear in the drop down field. You'll also want to make sure that the correct .css file is properly being enqueued at the top of the template file.

**Step 4:**
Once setup, you can assign the template to your form from the 'Manage List' page. Make sure to select the checkbox 'use custom form' and then in the drop down select your newly created template.

= I'm trying to set up the opt-in commenting checkbox. When users opt-in and leave a comment, an error is thrown and I can't figure out why. What could be wrong? =
For the optin comment check box, you'll want to make sure that the form you have set to assign users to only has the email field set to required.

= I'd like to define my own default value tags. For example, I want to populate a field with the current page URL dynamically. Is this possible? =
Yes! In the release of YIKES Inc. Easy MailChimp Extender version 5.2 we enabled all sorts of new features. One of these features is the ability to pre-populate text fields with a string of text, or with one fo the provided default value tags.
The default value tags available to you out of the box are :
* {post_title} - populates the field with the current <strong>page or post title</strong> that the user was on when they subscribed to the form.
* {post_id} - populates the field with the current <strong>page or post ID</strong> that the user was on when they subscribed to the form.
* {page_url} - populates the field with the current <strong>page URL</strong> that the user was on when they subscribed to the form.
* {blog_name} - populates the field with the current <strong>blog name</strong>. Very useful for multi-site installations, when tracking which blog the user has signed up from is crucial to your marketing efforts.
* {user_logged_in} - populates the field with with a dynamic value based on weather the user is logged in or not. When the user is logged in when signing up, the field populates with "User Logged In". If the user is not logged in, "Guest".

Simply click the link below the default value input field to add that tag as the default value. Easy as that!

We've also provided a way for you to define your own default value tags, and return any data you choose. This is done through the use of two separate filters ( `yikes_mailchimp_default_value_tag` and `yikes_mailchimp_process_default_value_tag` ). Check out the developer documentation for how to use the filters. The examples provided are extremely helpful.

= Can I move the success/error message to below the form instead of displaying them above? =
Yes! In version 5.3, we've allowed users to declare a constant which dictate where the error and success messages will appear in relation to the forms.

By default , the error and success messages appear above the form. If you'd like them to appear below the form, simply add the following definition to your active themes function.php file.

`
define( "display_yikes_mc_form_messages", "after" );

**Helper Functions**

**Description:**
These functions are defined inside of the Easy MailChimp plugin and they exist to help test and view the user data that is being submitted by the user through the MailChimp form. These functions will prevent the default form functionality, so no user data will be sent to MailChimp while testing.

These functions should be used in conjunction with the `yikes_mc_get_form_data` or the `yikes_mc_get_form_data_$formID` filters. Whatever data the user has provided will be returned for viewing.

**Provided Functions**
`yks_mc_print_user_data( $form_ID, $merge_variables );` and `yks_mc_dump_user_data( $form_ID, $merge_variables );`


**How to Use**
*Print User Data*
`
<?php
	/**
	* This example will return all of the submitted 
	* user data In a nice readable format
	*/
	function print_user_data_from_form( $form_ID, $merge_variables ) {
		if( class_exists( 'yksemeBase' ) ) {
			$yikes_easy_mailchimp = new yksemeBase();
		}
		$yikes_easy_mailchimp->yks_mc_print_user_data( $form_ID, $merge_variables );
	}
	add_filter( 'yikes_mc_get_form_data' , 'print_user_data_from_form', 10, 2 );
?>
`
*Dump User Data*
`
<?php
	/**
	* This example will dump all of the submitted 
	* user data, so you can see the full array of data
	* being returned
	*/
	function dump_user_data_from_form( $form_ID, $merge_variables ) {
		if( class_exists( 'yksemeBase' ) ) {
			$yikes_easy_mailchimp = new yksemeBase();
		}
		$yikes_easy_mailchimp->yks_mc_dump_user_data( $form_ID, $merge_variables );
	}
